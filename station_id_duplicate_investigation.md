# Station ID Duplicate Issue Investigation

## Problem Summary

The `gold_station_performance_dashboard` transformation contains duplicate stations - multiple rows with the same (station_name, lat, lon) but different station_id formats. This investigation traced the root cause to inconsistent station ID formatting in the external CitiBike trip data feed.

## Symptoms

- **93 stations** appear twice in the performance dashboard
- Each duplicate has the same physical location (name, lat, lon) but different station IDs and different metrics for total trips, imbalance, and so on.

## Investigation Process

### 1. Dashboard Duplicate Analysis
**Query**: Group dashboard by (station_name, lat, lon) and count duplicates
**Result**: Found 93 stations with 2 records each

### 2. Data Flow Tracing
**Hypothesis**: Duplicates created by joins between `gold_dim_stations` and aggregated trip activity data
**Finding**: Both `.1` and `.10` station ID formats in the aggregated trip activity successfully join to a `short_name` in `gold_dim_stations`, creating duplicate dashboard rows

### 3. gold_dim_stations Analysis
**Query**: Check duplicates in station dimension table
**Finding**: 
- GBFS source: Uses `.10` format where `short_name` ≠ `station_id` (with a handful of exceptions)
- Reconstructed source: Uses `.1` format where `short_name` = `station_id`
- Both sources contain records for the same physical stations

### 4. Trip Activity Data Analysis
**Query**: Check aggregated trip activity for duplicate station IDs
**Result**: Found 72 stations where same physical location has both `.1` and `.10` station id formats in trip data

### 5. Pipeline Stage Analysis
**Approach**: Check distinct station ID counts at each processing stage
**Results**:
- `raw_trips_current`: 94 distinct `.10` stations, 97 distinct `.1` stations
- `stg_trips_current`: 30 distinct `.10` stations, 1 distinct `.1` station  
- `silver_trips`: 94 distinct `.10` stations, 97 distinct `.1` stations

**Conclusion**: No corruption in our pipeline - raw data already contains both formats

### 6. Raw Data Verification
**Query**: Find physical stations with multiple station ID formats in raw external data
```sql
SELECT
  start_station_name,
  start_lat,
  start_lng,
  COUNT(DISTINCT start_station_id) as distinct_station_ids,
  ARRAY_AGG(DISTINCT start_station_id ORDER BY start_station_id) as all_station_ids
FROM raw_trips_current
WHERE start_station_id LIKE '%.1' OR start_station_id LIKE '%.10'
GROUP BY start_station_name, start_lat, start_lng
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT start_station_id) > 1
```

**Result**: **85+ physical stations** have both formats in raw data
**Examples**:
- "2 Ave & E 99 St": `["7386.1", "7386.10"]`
- "24 Ave & 26 St": `["7152.1", "7152.10"]` 
- "3 Ave & E 82 St": `["7154.1", "7154.10"]`

## Root Cause

**The issue originates in CitiBike's external trip data feed**, not our processing pipeline.

CitiBike's systems have been inconsistent over time:
- Some periods/systems use trailing zero format: `"1234.10"`
- Other periods/systems drop trailing zeros: `"1234.1"`
- Both formats refer to the same physical stations

This likely results from string-to-float-to-string conversions in CitiBike's upstream systems:
```
"1234.10" → 1234.1 (float) → "1234.1" (string)
```

## Impact on Pipeline

1. **Raw trip data** contains both formats for same physical stations
2. **Reconstructed stations** logic picks up the `.1` format from trips 
3. **GBFS station data** provides the canonical `.10` format
4. **gold_dim_stations** unions both without deduplication by physical location
5. **Dashboard joins** find matches for both formats, creating duplicate rows

## Solution Strategy

Implement **station ID normalization** to handle the upstream data inconsistency:

1. **Standardize to `.10` format** (matches GBFS canonical format)
2. **Apply normalization early** in the pipeline (ideally in `silver_trips`)
3. **Normalize function**: Convert `xxxx.1` → `xxxx.10` for single-digit decimals
4. **Deduplicate gold_dim_stations** by physical location, prioritizing GBFS over reconstructed

## Evidence Summary

- ✅ **External data issue confirmed**: Raw trip data contains both formats
- ✅ **Pipeline integrity verified**: No corruption introduced by our transformations  
- ✅ **Scope quantified**: 85+ stations affected with systematic `.1`/`.10` pattern
- ✅ **Root cause identified**: CitiBike upstream data inconsistency over time
- ✅ **Solution path clear**: Normalize station IDs to handle external inconsistency

## Solution Implementation

### Fix Applied
Created a dbt macro to normalize station IDs consistently:

**File: `macros/normalize_station_id.sql`**
```sql
{% macro normalize_station_id(station_id_field) %}
  CASE 
    WHEN REGEXP_CONTAINS({{ station_id_field }}, r'^\d+\.\d+$')
    THEN FORMAT("%.2f", CAST({{ station_id_field }} AS FLOAT64))
    ELSE {{ station_id_field }}
  END
{% endmacro %}
```

**Applied normalization to:**
1. **`silver_trips.sql`**: Normalized `start_station_id` and `end_station_id` in the `unified_base` CTE
2. **`silver_stations.sql`**: Added `normalized_stations` CTE to normalize `short_name` field

### Production Deployment Commands

**1. Deploy the fix:**
```bash
# Navigate to dbt directory
cd dbt_transformations

# Full refresh silver layer to apply normalization to all data
dbt run --select silver_trips silver_stations --full-refresh --target prod

# Rebuild downstream gold models
dbt run --select +gold_station_performance_dashboard --target prod
```

**2. Verification queries:**

**Check silver layer normalization worked:**
```sql
-- Verify no .1 format station IDs remain in silver_trips
SELECT 
  start_station_id,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM `citibike-pipeline.citibike.silver_trips`
WHERE start_station_id LIKE '%.1' AND start_station_id NOT LIKE '%.1[0-9]'
GROUP BY start_station_id
ORDER BY start_station_id
-- Expected: No results (all .1 should be normalized to .10)

-- Verify no .1 format station IDs remain in silver_stations  
SELECT 
  short_name,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM `citibike-pipeline.citibike.silver_stations`
WHERE short_name LIKE '%.1' AND short_name NOT LIKE '%.1[0-9]'
GROUP BY short_name
ORDER BY short_name
-- Expected: No results (all .1 should be normalized to .10)
```

**Check dashboard duplicates eliminated:**
```sql
-- Verify dashboard duplicates are eliminated
SELECT 
  station_name, lat, lon,
  COUNT(*) as duplicate_count
FROM `citibike-pipeline.citibike.gold_station_performance_dashboard`
GROUP BY station_name, lat, lon
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY duplicate_count DESC
-- Expected: No results (zero duplicates)
```

### Test Results
- ✅ **Dev testing**: 4k rows processed, all station IDs normalized to `.10` format
- ✅ **Downstream impact**: Dashboard duplicates reduced to zero
- ✅ **Legacy stations**: Automatically filtered out by NULL short_name values
- ✅ **No collisions**: Normalization safe (no existing conflicts)
